        <p>
            The 'finding data' demo catalogue exists to provide access to metadata, describing the
            data held across the Defra group, to make it 'findable'.
        </p>

        <p>
            The metadata extracted from other systems is translated into a common format, and
            then made searchable. As a result of this aggregation it is possible to measure the quality
            of the metadata, the underlying data, the processes that led to the creation of
            this data as well as obtain a better understanding of the data Defra holds.
